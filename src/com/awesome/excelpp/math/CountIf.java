/**
 * The CountIf function counts the number of cells within a range that meet a single criterion that you specify.
 * <p>For example, you can count all the cells that start with a certain letter,
 * or you can count all the cells that contain a number that is larger or smaller than a number you specify.
 * For example, suppose you have a spreadsheet that contains a list of tasks in column A,
 * and the first name of the person assigned to each task in column B.
 * You can use the CountIf function to count how many times a person's name appears in column B and,
 * in that way, determine how many tasks are assigned to that person. For example: =CountIf(B2:B25,"Nancy");
 * </br>Syntax: =CountIf(range, criteria);</p>
