/**
 * You use the SumIf function to sum the values in a range that meet criteria that you specify.
 * <p>For example, suppose that in a column that contains numbers,
 * you want to sum only the values that are larger than 5. You can use the following formula: =SumIf(B2:B25,">5");
 * In this example, the criteria is applied the same values that are being summed.
 * If you want, you can apply the criteria to one range and sum the corresponding values in a different range.
 * For example, the formula =SumIf(B2:B5, "John", C2:C5); sums only the values in the range C2:C5,
 * where the corresponding cells in the range B2:B5 equal "John".
 * Syntax: =SumIf(range, criteria, [sum_range]);</p>
